## Description
A simple implementation of the classic game **Minesweeper** built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

In this game, the player needs to clear a grid of cells without triggering any mines. The player can flag suspected mines and attempt to open all safe cells. The game is over if a mine is triggered, and the player wins by revealing all safe cells.

## Features
- **Grid generation**: Dynamically create a grid based on user input (rows, columns, and mines).
- **Mine placement**: Random mine generation.
- **Flagging**: Right-click to flag or unflag cells.
- **Timer**: Stopwatch functionality to track how long the player takes.
- **Game Over/Win detection**: Alerts when the game ends, either by triggering a mine or revealing all safe cells.

## Controls
- **Left click** to open a cell.
- **Right click** to flag or unflag a cell.
- **ðŸ™‚** (smiley) click to start a new game.

## How to Play
1. Left-click on any cell to open it.
2. If the cell contains a number, it indicates the number of adjacent mines.
3. Right-click on a cell to flag it, indicating that you think it contains a mine.
4. Continue clicking until you've revealed all non-mine cells or triggered a mine.
5. If you open a cell with a mine, the game ends.
6. If you reveal all non-mine cells, you win the game!
